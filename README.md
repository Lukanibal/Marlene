COMMANDS:
-
`think` will expend 1 of you 5 daily THINK TOKENS for an indepth thoughtful response using the thinking model. This burns tokens like a bastard though, hence the 5 daily tokens per user.
  
`speak` will make her say what you type, be kind!
  
MESSAGE TYPES:
-
`(tts)`, `(speak)`, and `(say)` in a message directed at her will make her respond with her dazzling voice!
